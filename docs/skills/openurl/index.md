title: Open URL
---

## Introduction

This skill open an URL when a button is pressed. Which is useful for opening a web page or a file.

## How it works

This skill uses the `open_url` function from the [PC Controller](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/pccontroller/) class in the device script core library to open the URL.

You can customize the URL by changing the `$URL` variable in the config tab. Which will be replaced when compiled to program and uploaded to the device.
